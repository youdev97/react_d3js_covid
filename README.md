# DataViz Belgium's Hospitals situation Covid-19

DataViz with D3.js v5 LineCharts & MapChart that displays last updated data about Belgium's hospitals situation during COVID-19.

Based on [my first personnal project on D3.js(v5)](https://gitlab.com/youdev97/d3js_covid) and to improve my skills in JS I decided to combine it with ReactJS

## LineChart

I built a LineChart class that is used 2 times to create a graph about the number of hospital's intakes in Belgium and an another one with the total number of patients for the last few months.

## Map

I also use MapChart that represents Belgium and on mouse move or click on one region you get the situations of Hospitals in that region.
